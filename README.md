# applied-cryptography-experiment
## Why I built this
An academic cryptography experiment focused on encryption using keys generated from unconventional system entropy sources. 

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of cryptographic ciphers and explore how entropy can be used to design efficient encryption schemes.


## Recommended Environment

- **Python 3.10**
- Operating System: **Windows** 

It's recommended because different environments may lead to unexpected results.

No external libraries are required. Only Python standard libraries are used. 

## How To Run

* Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mariojuniorr/applied-cryptography-experiment
cd applied-cryptography-experiment
```
* Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* Run the app
```bash
python cryptography-experiment
```
